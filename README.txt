How to test the module :
- Open index.html with any browser.
- It will by default load a local database located in : AngularJsTest/resources/database/database.txt
- If the file does not exist or if the file is empty, then it will create a simple tree with one node.
- On the html page you can ADD, REMOVE, HIDE / SHOW children elements.
- You can also SAVE the state of the tree on the page. if you restart / refresh the page then it will load the tree as it was saved previously.


Additional info, what did I use :
- AngularJS framework
- Bootstrap for the style
- I created a php handler to deal with persistent data
